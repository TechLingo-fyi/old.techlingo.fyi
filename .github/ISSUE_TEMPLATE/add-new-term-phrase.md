**What term or phrase do you want to add?**
A good *techlingo* is an acronym or a short phrase.

**If you know it, please provide a brief explanation of the term**
Ideally, a good explanation should fit in no more than 240 characters, though this is not a strict rule â€“ write as much as you need.

**Where did you see this phrase/term being used?**
Was it in a book or a tech talk? can you provide an example?
